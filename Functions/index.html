The folder includes the set of functions to be used to evaluate the performance of sleep-tracking technology.
The following functions are included:

- ebe2sleep.R uses the epoch-by-epoch dataset to generate a dataset of sleep measures.
- indDiscr.R uses the dataset generated by ebe2sleep.R to generate a dataset individual-level discrepancies.
- groupDiscr.R uses the dataset generated with ebe2sleep.R to compute gorup-level discrepancy metrics.
- BAplot.R uses the dataset generated with ebe2sleep.R to generate a Bland-Altman plot for a specific measure.
- errorMatrix.R uses the epoch-by-epoch dataset to compute an error matrix.
- indEBE.R uses the epoch-by-epoch dataset to compute epoch-by-epoch performance metrics for each subject.
- groupEBE.R uses the epoch-by-epoch dataset to compute epoch-by-epoch performance metrics for the whole sample.
